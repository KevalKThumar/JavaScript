<!-- 
The DOM stands for Document Object Model. In the context of JavaScript, the DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page or an XML document as a tree-like structure of objects. It provides a way for scripts to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web document.
DOM is the Document Object Model of HTML document.
It represents the logical structure of the document and enables JavaScript to access and manipulate the contents of the document.
It represents the logical structure of the document and enables programs to change its contents.
The following terms will help you understand this concept better:-

1) Document: Represents the entire web page or XML document.
2) Element: Represents individual HTML or XML elements on the page, such as <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc.
3) Node: The basic unit in the DOM, representing any individual part of the document, whether it's an 
         element, attribute, or text content.
4) Attribute: Represents attributes of an element, like class, id, src, etc.
5) Text Node: Represents the text content within an element.
6) Parent and Child Nodes: Elements in the DOM are arranged in a hierarchical structure, where elements 
                           can be parents (containing child elements) or children (nested inside parent 
                           elements).


const item = Document.getElementById("keval")
item has total three property for show the text in side the selected id 
 1)innerText = It will show that string that is display in webpage backgroung text 
               does not show
 2)textContent = It will show all the content that are in selected id 
 3)innerHTML = It will give as a full inner HTML value as a string 


  ******************************QuerySelectorInDom******************************

   For the selection of the element is same as the CSS selector 
     for id =>#keval
     for class =>.keval
     for tag => h1,h2,p,img etc....
     for input => input[type="password"]

  There were main to type of collection which is given by a selector query:-
  1)HTMLCollection: getElementById,getElementByClass
  2)NodeCollection: querySelector(Select only first element),querySelectorAll

  HTMLCollection:
         1) it does not have ayn kind of looping function. for the use of loop we are convert HTMLCollection to array by writting this:
         Array.from(name); 
   NodeCollection: 
        -> it has only one loop that is forEach for
