# JavaScript Journey and Mini Projects

ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone!

I wanted to share a quick update on my JavaScript journey. ðŸš€ I've been learning the ropes of JavaScript with the incredible tutorials from [Chai aur Code's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5iLG7sUa0&list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37&pp=iAQB&ab_channel=ChaiaurCode). The experience has been incredibly rewarding and enlightening.

## Projects Completed

I'm thrilled to let you know that I've successfully completed six mini projects that have helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts. Here's a quick overview:

1. [Project 1](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/): clicking on one of the colors above
to change the background color of this page!
2. [Project 2](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/): BMI Calculator
3. [Project 3](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/):Show Your local time.
4. [Project 4](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/): Try and guess a random number between 1 and 100. You have 10 attempts to guess the right number.
5. [Project 5](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/): Press the key and watch magic
6. [Project 6](https://dom-project-kappa.vercel.app/): Change the Background color every second

These projects have given me hands-on experience and helped me sharpen my coding skills. You can check out all the code and details in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KevalKThumar/JavaScript).

## What's Next? ðŸŒŸ

As I continue to learn and grow, I'm excited to share that I've embarked on a journey to explore React! ðŸŽ‰ I'm looking forward to building dynamic and interactive web applications that take user experiences to the next level.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement throughout this journey. Here's to continuous learning and the joy of coding! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“š

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive into the world of React!
