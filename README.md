# JavaScript Journey and Mini Projects

ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone!

I wanted to share a quick update on my JavaScript journey. ðŸš€ I've been learning the ropes of JavaScript with the incredible tutorials from [Chai aur Code's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5iLG7sUa0&list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37&pp=iAQB&ab_channel=ChaiaurCode). The experience has been incredibly rewarding and enlightening.

## Projects Completed

I'm thrilled to let you know that I've successfully completed six mini projects that have helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts. Here's a quick overview:

These projects have given me hands-on experience and helped me sharpen my coding skills. You can check out all the code and details in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KevalKThumar/JavaScript).
